//1. Write an improved version of hello world that says hello firstName lastName

//2. Display the sum of 5 + 10, using two variables: x and y.

//3. Create a variable called z, assign x + y to it, and log the result 

//4. Write a program that takes a temperature in Celsius degrees, then logs it in Fahrenheit degrees. The conversion formula is [°F] = [°C] x 9/5 + 32.

//5. Look at the following code and try to predict the final values of its variables. Run the code too see if you were correct
let a = 2;
a -= 1;
a++;
let b = 8;
b += 2;
const c = a + b * b;
const d = a * b + b;
const e = a * (b + b);
const f = a * b / a;
const g = b / a * a;
console.log(a, b, c, d, e, f, g);

//Bonus: Swap the values of the 2 variables without creating any new variables

let firstNumber = 4;
let secondNumber = 9;
// your code here
